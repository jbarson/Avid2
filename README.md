# AVID application for AdAstraGames

## Technology Stack

Here are the technologies that I plan on using for the project:

* Angular JS (version2)
* SCSS for styling
* SVG for graphics
* Karma/Jasmine/Protractor for tests

## Purpose of this project

I want to get a new version of the existing AVID operational. The minimum product for the first release will have all of the functionality of the Legacy Avid (By Jerome). Additional features will be added after that.

I would like to make this a "showpiece" project.
